The Master of Science in Applied Data Science program at Syracuse University equips students with a strong skill set in data science disciplines, emphasizing technical proficiency and ethical awareness. 
As Graduates, we emerge as competent data science practitioners with the ability to navigate the full data science life cycle. 
This portfolio showcases projects from the diverse courses taken at Syracuse University, highlighting the application of quantitative reasoning, scripting for data analysis, natural language processing, text mining, applied machine learning, and big data analytics. 
Through these projects, I demonstrated my capacity to collect, store, and access data, create actionable insights, apply visualization and predictive models, use programming languages effectively, and communicate findings ethically to various audiences.
In this GitHub are the Portoflio Projects as well as the accompying write that explains the project and any code used in detail.
